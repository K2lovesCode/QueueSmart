1. The Goal
Create a simple and smart web application to manage Parent-Teacher Meeting queues in real-time. The goal is to eliminate scheduling conflicts and reduce parent anxiety by replacing fixed time slots with a dynamic, "just-in-time" notification system.

The system will have three distinct interfaces for three types of users: Parents, Teachers, and School Admins.

2. The Parent's Experience (Simple & Stress-Free)
Parents use their own smartphones without needing to download an app. The process is designed to be seamless for parents with one or multiple children.

First-Time Entry: The very first time a parent uses the app during the event, a welcome screen asks for their name. This is done only once to identify them for the session.

Joining a Queue (for a specific child):

A parent can join a teacher's queue in one of two ways:

Scan the QR code displayed outside the classroom.

Manually type in the teacher's unique code (e.g., "JONES7").

This action opens a webpage on their phone.

The page immediately asks for the Child's Name and Grade for this specific teacher. This step is repeated every time they join a new teacher's queue, ensuring the correct child is linked to the correct teacher.

The Dashboard: After submitting their child's info, they are taken to a simple dashboard showing a card for each teacher queue they've joined.

Simple Status Updates: Each card clearly shows their status with a large, color-coded banner. There are only three statuses:

IN QUEUE (Gray): "You're all set. We'll notify you when it's getting close."

GETTING CLOSE (Yellow): "You are next in line. Please start making your way to the classroom."

YOUR TURN NOW! (Green): "The teacher is ready for you now. Please enter the classroom."

No Numbers, No Stress: The parent never sees their position number or an estimated wait time. They are only notified when action is needed.

Notifications: The app will send two key notifications to the parent's phone: a "heads-up" when they are next, and a "go now" alert when the teacher is ready.

3. The Teacher's Experience (The Control Panel)
Teachers use a dedicated dashboard on a tablet or laptop.

Secure Login: Each teacher has their own secure login (email and password).

Personal Dashboard: After logging in, the teacher sees their personal dashboard which is a simple queue management tool.

Dashboard View: The screen is divided into two main sections:

Current Meeting: Shows the name of the parent/student they are currently with and a running timer.

Up Next / Queue: Shows the parent who will be called next, and a simple list of the other parents waiting.

Simple Controls: The teacher has three main buttons to control the flow:

End Meeting: This is the primary button. When pressed, the system automatically sends the "YOUR TURN NOW!" notification to the next available parent in the queue.

Extend Meeting (5 min): If a meeting is running long, the teacher can press this button. The system will then automatically send a polite "slight delay" notification to the parent who is next in line.

Skip / No-Show: If a parent doesn't show up, the teacher can press this to remove them from the queue and immediately call the next person.

Smart System: The teacher doesn't have to worry about conflicts. If their next parent is currently busy with another teacher, the system will automatically skip them and notify the next available parent, keeping the line moving smoothly.

4. The Admin's Experience (The Command Center)
Admins use a comprehensive web dashboard to set up and monitor the event.

Secure Login: Admins have their own secure login.

Feature 1: Setup & QR Code Generation:

Before the event, the admin adds teachers to the system by entering their name, subject, and grade.

For each teacher added, the system instantly generates both a unique QR code and a short, easy-to-type unique code (e.g., 'SMITH12').

How it's linked: Thehat specific teacher. When a parent  unique toscans teacher. The unique code th also directly linked to that same and automatically places the par QR code or types in the uniqueent in the coreacher, who is logged them own separate dashboard, will then see that parent appear in their waiting list.

The admin can then easily print these QR codes to be displayed outside each classroom.

Feature 2: Live Event Mo and their corresponding unique codesnitoring:

During the PTM, the admin can view a "God View" dashboard.

This dashboard shows a real-time overview of the entire event. The admin can see every teacher, who they are currently meeting with, and how many parents are waiting in each teacher's queue.

This allows the admin to identify potential bottlenecks and help manage the event flow.
